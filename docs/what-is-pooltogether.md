The PoolTogether Protocol promotes financial security by making it fun to save!

1. 🏦 **Users deposit tokens**
2. 📈 **Yield accrues on deposits**
3. 🏆 **The yield is randomly awarded as prizes!**
4. 💰 **Users can withdraw their funds at any time**

Never lose your principal, and have a chance to win big.

## What's New in V5

Version 5 of PoolTogether brings massive improvements. The protocol is now:

- **Autonomous:** there is no central entity (whether an admin or governance) controlling the protocol.
- **Permissionless:** anyone will be able to add new assets and yield sources to the protocol.

To find out more, the best place to start is the [Protocol Design](design/index.md).
