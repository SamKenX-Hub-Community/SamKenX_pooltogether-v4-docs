title: PoolTogether Architecture
---

A few of the major components that make up PoolTogether V4.

- [**Prize Pool Network**](./prize-pools-network/): A Prize Pool Network allows users across chains, with different assets, or different yield sources to combine their interest and share a single pool of prize liquidity.

- [**Prize Distribution**](./prize-distribution/): A statistical approach to distribute prizes to many users across many chains.

- [**Time-Weighted Average Balance**](./time-weighted-average-balance/): A TWAB is a user's balance at any time in the past, or their average balance held between two timestamps.

- [**Computing Prizes**](./computing-prizes/): Computing prizes is a calculation-intensive process done off chain. Prizes are then submitted to the contract for verification when claiming.

- [**Flow of funds**](./flow-of-funds/): See how funds are managed for a single Prize Pool.

- [**V4 Launch Architecture**](./launch-architecture/): Learn more about the state of the Prize Pool Network at the launch.
